We will use R! Coding to visualize climate change in NYC. 

1. Download NYC Temperature Data 
   Link to data on Google Drive:
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XvkapbADZaXl77W0-tYt5y1g-OmhQ_r4B7hJbki4OOY/edit?usp=sharing
   - Go to file/download/csv
   - You will get a file called:  NYC temp 1990-2020 - NYCtemp.csv
   - Rename file to: NYCtemp.csv  
   
   Link to data in github: 
   https://github.com/ereedsanchez/Learning-R-Enviornmental-/blob/main/Lesson-4-NYC-Global-Warming/NYC-temp.csv
   

2. Replit upload NYCtemp.csv - files/three dots/upload file
